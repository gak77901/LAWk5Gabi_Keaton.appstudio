/*
Create a variable named 'quoteString' and put this quote in it: 

Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again this time more intelligently.

Use the 'toUpperCase' string method to change the text in 'quoteString' to all upper case. 
Output the changed string to the console using this format: 
               Upper case string is: XXXXX
               
Create a variable named 'authorString' and put this text in it:
               "- Henry Ford"

Read about this string method 'concat()' Use it to create a new string variable 'completeString' that holds a string created by adding 'authorString'  to the end of 'quoteString'. 
             Concatenated string is: XXXX

Create a new variable 'found' that uses the string method 'includes()' to determine if "Henry" is in 'completeString' or not.
              Henry was in completeString.
              OR
              Henry was NOT in completeString.
